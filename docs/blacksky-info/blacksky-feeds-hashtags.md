# Blacksky Feeds and Hashtags

Within Bluesky you can view content based on feeds or by hashtag. It is a common mistake to assume that custom feeds in Bluesky are similar to a subreddit.

They are not. Custom feeds in Bluesky are aggregators of content, not forums. You cannot post exclusively to any one feed at this time. Click to learn more about [Bluesky feeds](https://bsky.social/about/blog/7-27-2023-custom-feeds).

So, clicking the #Blacksky hashtag is not the same as using the official Blacksky Feed. The feed is chronologically ordered and the content is curated through human moderation, automation, and some pre-filtering logic.

The community also proactively reports content to our Blacksky Moderation Service [@blacksky.app](https://bsky.app/profile/blacksky.app). Also, see [How Do I Add Myself to the Blacksky Feed](/docs/blacksky-info/how-to-add).

A starter pack is a list of users and feeds that help new users find community quicker. The Blacksky Starter Pack is a curated list of the 50 most popular and active accounts from the Blacksky feeds.

Also includes Blacksky, Blacksky Trending, and the Blackademics feeds. To learn more about Bluesky starter packs, visit Bluesky's [blog post](https://bsky.social/about/blog/06-26-2024-starter-packs).
